            <h3>The Liturgy </h3><br>
            <p>The word <strong>“LITURGY”</strong> came from a Greek word which means “public duty”, a service, and a
                public organization. Its original meaning was some public action. When the word was adopted by the Church to
                describe her public “services” of worship its meaning changed. In Christian liturgy we are not talking
                about what we do but what God does. The Vatican council points out so clearly, the liturgy is the action
                of Jesus Christ, an action of eternal worship in which he involves us, the members of his mystical body,
                the Church.</p>
