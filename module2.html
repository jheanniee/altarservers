            <h3>The Liturgy </h3><br>
            <p>The word “LITURGY”came from a Greek word which means “public duty”, a service, and a public organization.
                Its original meaning was some public action. When the word was adopted by the Church to describe her
                public “services” of worship its meaning changed. In Christian liturgy we are not talking about what we
                do but what God does. The Vatican council points out so clearly, the liturgy is the action of Jesus
                Christ, an action of eternal worship in which he involves us, the members of his mystical body, the
                church</p>

            <p>Advent – The beginning of the church’s calendar. This celebrates the two-fold coming of Christ
                (Incarnation and Final Judgment). With Christian joy we celebrate his first coming. In Christian hope we
                await his second coming. This season lasts for four weeks, including the 9 days of Simbang Gabi. The
                season starts from the Sunday after Christ the King and ends the eve of Christ’s birth.
