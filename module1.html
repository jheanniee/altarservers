            <h3>INTRODUCTION TO THE MINISTRY OF ALTAR SERVERS</h3><br>
            <p> Being an Altar Server you are called a minister, a person who serves the parish community. As a
                minister, you should assist the community to celebrate the sacred liturgy, which is to serve God. You
                are mainly serving the priest to lead the community to God in prayer which is the work of the priests.
                You appear in public, but you are never a performer. By your faithful duty, you remain always a servant
                of God in your Parish. Blessed John Paul II said “you are far more than ‘helpers of the priest’. Above
                all, you are servants of Jesus the Eternal high Priest.”</p>

            <h1>Prayers:</h1><br>
            <span>Lord's Prayer</span><br>
            <p>Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth, as it is in
                heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. </p> <br>
            <span>Hail Mary</span>
            <p>Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of
                your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
            </p><br>
            <span>Glory Be</span>
            <p>Glory be to the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning is now and ever
                shall be. Amen.
            </p><br>
            <span>Apostles’ Creed</span>
            <p>I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son,
                our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate,
                was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the
                dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he
                will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the
                communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen

            <span>What is an Altar Server? Identity:</span>
            <p>In the same manner as the Ministries of Lectors and Holy Communion, the Ministry of Altar Servers are
                appointed on a temporary basis, thus they are commissioned, rather than instituted.<br><br>
                The primary role of the Altar Servers is to assist the priest in the celebration of the liturgy,
                especially during Mass. This is done through specific actions and by setting an example to the
                congregation by active participation.<br><br>
                There is nothing that prevents girls from becoming Altar Servers however, for practical reasons, and as
                a venue to attract vocations to the priesthood; it is highly recommended that boys are appointed for
                this ministry.
            </p><br>
            <span>What is an Altar Server? Identity:</span>
            <p>
                Reverence - Reverence for God and for sacred objects is most important when they serve. Reverent
                actions, peaceful and dignified behavior and gestures should be seen by the people when you stand at the
                sanctuary, for this adds solemnity to the celebration of the liturgy and contribute to the active
                participation of all.
                <br><br><br>
                Disipline - With good training and proper discipline, the rituals and ceremonies of the liturgy can be
                carried out in an orderly and solemn manner. But, as always, training involves discipline. Discipline
                among Altar Servers is expected in the following:<br><br>
                During the celebration of the liturgy, especially the mass<br>
                As they actively participate in the celebration;<br>
                As they avoid unnecessary movements that may cause distraction to others;<br>
                As they pay attention to every part of the Mass, at the same time being aware of the responsibilities
                and tasks;<br>
                As they avoid loitering and congregating in the sacristy or other places around the church;<br>
                As they work diligently with other lay liturgical ministers and even with priests<br>
                Outside of the celebration<br>
                In their relationship with others, especially with their family, friends, classmates and other persons
                whom they encounter;<br>
                In their care and concern, respect and reverence for the materials they use for the celebration of the
                liturgy, as well as the church and its other areas (e.g. sacristy);<br>
                In their respect for their elders;<br>
                In their willingness to undergo on-going formation and training.<br><br><br>


                Decorum - decorum means “what is proper.” Decorum requires a sense of dignity. Servers should not only
                do their work well, they should not just train well, they should, likewise, have a neat and tidy
                appearance since this adds to the dignity and beauty of the liturgical celebrations. This is shown in
                the following ways:<br><br>
                By keeping their uniforms neat and clean at all times, especially as they wear it during liturgical
                celebrations;<br>
                By being groomed;<br>
                By moving in dignified manner, with confidence and reverence for the liturgical celebration.<br><br><br>


                Piety - Piety does not mean they look holy whenever they serve at the altar. It means that they carry
                within themselves a great love for God and his people, even if they are not serving in the Church. Piety
                involves:<br><br>
                A good prayer life;<br>
                A deep love for the Eucharist and other Sacraments;<br>
                A devotion to the Blessed Mother;<br>
                A deep love for the Eucharist and other Sacraments;<br><br><br>


                Brotherhood- An Altar Server has an attitude of team-work, in serving you should understand that you are
                a part of a larger group. Always remember that in serving you should be united in the service of God.
                Brotherhood involves:<br><br>


                Witnessing – a life of witnessing that involves<br>
                Doing good to others at all times;<br>
                Being faithful to their responsibilities, not only in the church, but in their families, in School, in
                other places;<br>
                By avoiding bad habits and vices;<br>
                By being good example to others.<br>
                Teamwork – Serving at the altar is never a solo task. It is always done as a team of brothers. This is
                shown in the following ways.<br>
                By being aware of their own responsibility and the responsibility of other ministers as well;<br>
                By helping each other, being friendly and kind, not proud, boastful or competitive.<br>
                By welcoming newcomers and teaching them patiently;<br>
                By praying together with other ministers before and after liturgical celebrations;<br>
                By being a brother to their fellow servers.<br>
