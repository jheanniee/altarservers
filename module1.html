            <h3>The Introduction to the Ministry of Altar Server</h3><br>
            <p> Being an Altar Server you are called a minister, a person who serves the parish community. As a
                minister, you should assist the community to celebrate the sacred liturgy, which is to serve God. You
                are mainly serving the priest to lead the community to God in prayer which is the work of the priests.
                You appear in public, but you are never a performer. By your faithful duty, you remain always a servant
                of God in your Parish. Blessed John Paul II said “you are far more than ‘helpers of the priest’. Above
                all, you are servants of Jesus the Eternal high Priest.”</p>

            <span data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">Lord's Prayer</span><br>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150">Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come,
                Your will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
                trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. </p> <br>

            <span data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">Hail Mary</span>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150">Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you; blessed are you
                among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

            <span data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">Glory Be</span>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150">Glory be to the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. As
                it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be. Amen.

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150">I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and
                earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born 
                of the virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; He descended to hell. The third day He rose again
                from the dead. He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty. From
                there He will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic
                Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life
                everlasting. Amen.

            <span data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">What is an Altar Server? Identity:</span>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150"> <i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>In the same manner as the Ministries of Lectors and Holy Communion, the Ministry of Altar Servers are appointed on a temporary basis, thus they are commissioned, rather than instituted.<br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>The primary role of the Altar Servers is to assist the priest in the celebration of the liturgy, especially during Mass. This is done through specific actions and by setting an example to the congregation by active participation.<br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>There is nothing that prevents girls from becoming Altar Servers however, for practical reasons, and as a venue to attract vocations to the priesthood; it is highly recommended that boys are appointed for this ministry.
            </p><br>

            <span data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">Ideals of an Altar Server:</span>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i><u>Reverence</u> - Reverence for God and for sacred objects is most
                important when they serve. Reverent actions, peaceful and dignified behavior and gestures should be seen
                by the people when you stand at the sanctuary, for this adds solemnity to the celebration of the liturgy
                and contribute to the active participation of all. <br><br>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-2"></i><u>Disipline</u> - With good training and proper discipline, the rituals and ceremonies of the liturgy can be carried out in an orderly and solemn manner. But, as always, training involves discipline. Discipline among Altar Servers is expected in the following:<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>During the celebration of the liturgy, especially the mass;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>As they actively participate in the celebration;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>As they avoid unnecessary movements that may cause distraction to others;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>As they pay attention to every part of the Mass, at the same time being aware of the responsibilities and tasks;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>As they avoid loitering and congregating in the sacristy or other places around the church;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>As they work diligently with other lay liturgical ministers and even with priests;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>Outside of the celebration;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>In their relationship with others, especially with their family, friends, classmates and other persons whom they encounter;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>In their care and concern, respect and reverence for the materials they use for the celebration of the liturgy, as well as the church and its other areas (e.g. sacristy);<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>In their respect for their elders;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>In their willingness to undergo on-going formation and training.<br><br>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-3"></i><u>Decorum</u> - decorum means “what is proper.” Decorum requires a sense of dignity. Servers should not only do their work well, they should not just train well, they should, likewise, have a neat and tidy appearance since this adds to the dignity and beauty of the liturgical celebrations. This is shown in the following ways:<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>By keeping their uniforms neat and clean at all times, especially as they wear it during liturgical celebrations;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>By being groomed;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>By moving in dignified manner, with confidence and reverence for the liturgical celebration.<br><br>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-4"></i><u>Piety</u> - Piety does not mean they look holy whenever they serve at the altar. It means that they carry within themselves a great love for God and his people, even if they are not serving in the Church. Piety involves:<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>A good prayer life;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>A deep love for the Eucharist and other Sacraments;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>A devotion to the Blessed Mother;<br>
                &ensp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>A deep love for the Eucharist and other Sacraments;<br><br>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-5"></i><u>Brotherhood</u>- An Altar Server has an attitude of team-work, in serving you should understand that you are a part of a larger group. Always remember that in serving you should be united in the service of God. Brotherhood involves:<br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>Witnessing – a life of witnessing that involves:<br>
                &emsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>Doing good to others at all times;<br>
                &emsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>Being faithful to their responsibilities, not only in the church, but in their families, in School, in other places;<br>
                &emsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>By avoiding bad habits and vices;<br>
                &emsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>By being good example to others.<br><br>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i>Teamwork – Serving at the altar is never a solo task. It is always done as a team of brothers. This is shown in the following ways.<br>
                &emsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>By being aware of their own responsibility and the responsibility of other ministers as well;<br>
                &emsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>By helping each other, being friendly and kind, not proud, boastful or competitive.<br>
                &emsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>By welcoming newcomers and teaching them patiently;<br>
                &emsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>By praying together with other ministers before and after liturgical celebrations;<br>
                &emsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>By being a brother to their fellow servers.<br>
