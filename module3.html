            <h3>The Mass </h3><br>
            <p>As an Altar Server, it is important for each server to know the structure of the Mass. It is not merely a
                matter of knowing “what comes next” but of understanding the meaning of each part of the Holy Mass. The
                Mass itself is an action moving steadily forward to its supreme moments, when Heaven and Earth meet in
                the great mystery of the Altar. </p><br><br>
            <h3>Parts of the Mass:</h3>
