            <h3>The Basic Postures and Gestures</h3><br><br>
            <p>An Altar Server must know and understand every posture appropriate for the ceremony. And he should also
                know all the actions that should be done in every part of the Mass. As a Server you should know when to
                move, walk and to bow.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <span>THE HANDS:</span><br>
            <p>Your hands must always be clean, with clean fingernails. Wash them before you serve for you will handle
                things which are holy.
                <br>
                Joined hands are held before the breast at 45 degrees, palms together, fingers extended, thumbs crossed,
                right over left.
                <br>
                When one of your hands is occupied, place the other hand open on your breast.
                <br>
                When seated, put your hands on your knees.
            </p>
            <br>
            <span>STANDING</span>
            <p>An altar Server’s head should be kept straight. The body is relaxed but erect, shoulders back. The feet
                are together. The hands are together before the breast at 45 degrees, palms together, fingers extended,
                thumbs crossed, right over left.</p><br>
            <span>WALKING</span>
            <p>While walking, walk solemnly, dignified and deliberately. Know where to go and walk there with head
                straight, shoulders back, and hand held properly.</p><br>
            <span>SITTING</span>
            <p>When sitting, keep back straight and tall. The hand should be placed at the lap. The feet should be flat
                on the ground.</p><br>
            <span>KNEELING</span>
            <p>When kneeling, allow the body weight be equally distributed on both knees. Leave the feet uncrossed and
                keep the hands in praying position.</p><br>
            <span>GENUFLECTING</span>
            <p>Single Genuflecting - One goes down on their right knee, keeping the left one upright, from a standing
                position. The server gets back up, but not like a spring, that is, quickly. Nor slowly (with exception
                to medical issues).<br>

                Double Genuflect - starts from the single genuflection position. This genuflection involved both knees
                planted on the ground, the servers’ hands still in the orans position (unless carrying an object) and a
                moderate bow is made.</p><br>
            <span>BOWING</span>
            <p>Shoulder Bow - both the head and the shoulders moves as one action. Bow only slightly forward.<br>

                Waist Bow - both the head and the shoulder move together but with the bending of the waist.</p><br><br>
